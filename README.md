# Docker Images
Images for development environments, with two main flavors currently that are updated every week:

### Flavors:
- `arch`: A minimal ArchLinux environment with essential tools, pacman keyring setup, pre-installed AUR support via paru (requires base-devel), and performance-optimized packages from ALHP.
- `arch-devel`: Everything from the `arch flavor` with additional development tools and packages, including base-devel.
